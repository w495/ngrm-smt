# API

All types are formally defined in `erleveldb.hrl`.


## Opaque Resource Types

    db() -> term()
    iterator() -> term()
    write_batch() -> term()
    snapshot() -> term()


### Type Descriptions

* `dbname()` will be used as the directory name that contains the database
  so you should consider filesystem constraints.
* `dbopts()` affect how a database is opened and the various performance
  settings associated with that database.
* `ikey()` and `ival()` are the types accepted as arguments for key/value
  arguments the entire API.
* `key()` and `val()` although function arguments are allowed to be any
  `iolist()` erleveldb will always return values as simple `binary()`s.
* `readopts()` control how individual read operations behave.
* `writeopts()` control how individual write operations behave.
* `seek_dest()` is used by the iterator to seek in key space. This can be
  an `ikey()` or one of the atoms `first` or `last`.


### Valid values for the `dbopts()` proplist

* `create_if_missing` Create a new database disk structure if the
  database does not exist.
* `error_if_exists` Abort opening the database if it already exists.
* `paranoid_checks` Instruct the database code to check extensively for
  corruption the the database files.
* `{write_buffer_size, pos_integer()}` The amount of RAM in bytes to use
  to buffer writes before they are sorted and written to disk. Up to 2x the
  `write_buffer_size` may be stored in RAM at one time. The default is 4MiB.
* `{max_open_files, pos_integer()}` The maximum number of files to keep
  open for accessing the database. The default is 100 open files.
* `{cache_size, pos_integer()}` The amount of RAM in bytes to use as a
  cache for frequently read data blocks. The default is 8MiB.
* `{block_size, pos_integer()}` The size of a data block when writing to
  disk. The default is 4KiB.
* `{block_restart_interval, post_integer()}` The number of keys between
  restart points when delta encoding key prefixes. The default is 16. This
  option is usually left to the default.


### Valid values for the `readopts()` proplist

* `verify_checksums` Verify the checksums for data read during this
  request.
* `skip_cache` Do not store data read into the block cache. This is
  mostly useful for bulk reads when you don't expect to reread the
  data quickly.
* `{snapshot, Snapshot}` A database snapshot to read from. This will
  only return results that existed at a given state of the database.


### Valid values for the `writeopts()` proplist

* `sync` Call `fsync(2)` after the write operation to flush the
  operating system buffers to disk.
* `snapshot` Returns `{ok, snapshot()}` where the snapshot refers to
  a logical point in time just after this write complete but before
  any other modification to the database.


## Opening a database

    open_db(dbname()) -> {ok, db()} | error().
    open_db(dbname(), dbopts()) -> {ok, db()} | error().

This is pretty simple. By default `open_db/1,2` expect that the database
already exists. You can use the `dbopts()` to create the database and
optionally return an error if it already exists.


## Destroying a database

    destroy_db(db()) -> ok.

The one caveat of this function is that the actual destruction is delayed
until the db() reference has been garbage collected.


## Storing and Retrieving Data

    get(db(), ikey()) -> {ok, val()} | error().
    get(db(), ikey(), readopts()) -> {ok, val()} | error().

    put(db(), ikey(), ival()) -> ok | error().
    put(db(), ikey(), ival(), writeopts()) -> ok | {ok, val()} | error().

    del(db(), ikey()) -> ok | error().
    del(db(), ikey(), writeopts()) -> ok | {ok, snapshot()} | error().

These are pretty standard get/put/delete operations that you would expect
for any key/value store. The one added bonus is the support for snapshots
which is explained below.


## Database Iteration

    iter(db()) -> {ok, iterator()} | error().
    iter(db(), readopts()) -> {ok, iterator()} | error().

    seek(iterator(), seek_dest()) -> {ok, {key(), val()}} | error().
    next(iterator()) -> {ok, {key(), val()}} | error().
    prev(iterator()) -> {ok, {key(), val()}} | error().

The values for readopts() are the same as above. This API is a bit wonky
in so much as the `seek/2` returns the first key/value pair in the iterator.
This may change in the future.

Iterators also support the use of snapshots which are explained further
below.

It is important to note that a database will not be closed until all
iterators created from it are garbage collected.


## Batched updates

    batch(db()) -> {ok, write_batch()} | error().

    wb_put(write_batch(), ikey(), ival()) -> ok | error().
    wb_del(write_batch(), ikey()) -> ok | error().

    wb_clear(write_batch()) -> ok | error().

    wb_write(write_batch()) -> ok | error().
    wb_write(write_batch(), writeopts()) -> ok | {ok, snapshot()} | error().

Batched updates can be used to apply a series of put and delete operations
against a database as an atomic unit. The order of put and delete operations
is executed in the order specified. Thus, if you call `wb_put/3` with a key
and then subsequently call `wb_del/2` with the same key, that particular key
will not exist after the write batch is applied. Calling `wb_clear/1` will
empty the queued set of operations from this write batch.

The writeopts() are the same as described above.

It is important to note that a database will not be closed until all
write batches created from it have been garbage collected.


## Snapshots

    snapshot(db()) -> {ok, snapshot()} | error().

Snapshots are used to issue reads against a specific version of the
database. They can be returned from the whatever the current version of
the database happens to be with `snapshot/1` or they can be returned
from any of the three calls that make updates (`put`, `del`, `wb_write`).

To use a snapshot you just need to pass it to either of the read methods
in their `readopts()` options proplist.

Multiple snapshots can exist for a given database at any given time. It is
important to note that a database will not be closed until all snapshots
are garbage collected.
